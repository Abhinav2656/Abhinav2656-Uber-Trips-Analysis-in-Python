->Data Loading and Exploration:
          In the first program, we loaded the Uber dataset for September 2014 using pandas. We converted the "Date/Time" column to datetime format and extracted the hour from it. Then, we visualized the number of Uber rides per hour using a line plot. This initial exploration provided an overview of the temporal distribution of Uber rides throughout the day.

->Analysis of Patterns and Trends:
           The second program focused on analyzing patterns in Uber pickups. We sorted the data by base and date/time to analyze the time differences between consecutive pickups. By filtering out large time differences, we focused on more common intervals. This analysis revealed insights into the frequency and distribution of Uber pickups over time, highlighting periods of high and low activity.

->Data Visualizations:
        All three programs included data visualizations to illustrate relationships between different variables:


The first program visualized the temporal distribution of Uber rides per hour using a line plot. This visualization helped identify peak hours of activity.
The second program plotted the distribution of time differences between consecutive pickups using a scatter plot. This visualization provided insights into pickup patterns and intervals between rides.
The third program included scatter plots to visualize the relationship between the index and time differences. Additionally, it calculated and displayed the correlation coefficient between these variables.
